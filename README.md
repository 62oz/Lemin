Overview:
This project aims to simulate an ant farm where ants need to find the quickest path to get across a colony, composed of rooms and tunnels, from the start room (##start) to the end room (##end) with as few moves as possible. The program should read from a file that describes the colony and the ants and output the results in the desired format.

Installation:
The program is written in Go, so you need to have Go installed in your system to compile and run the program. You can download Go from the official website (https://golang.org/doc/install).

Usage:
To run the program, you need to pass a file that describes the colony and the ants as an argument to the program. For example:

go

$ go run lem-in.go < input.txt

The program will read from the input file and output the results in the standard output in the desired format.

Input Format:
The input file should follow the following format:

number_of_ants
the_rooms
the_links

where number_of_ants is an integer that represents the number of ants that need to cross the colony, the_rooms is a list of rooms in the colony, and the_links is a list of tunnels that connect the rooms. The format of the rooms and the links should follow the format described in the project description.

Output Format:
The program should output the results in the standard output in the following format:

number_of_ants
the_rooms
the_links
Lx-y Lz-w Lr-o ...

where number_of_ants, the_rooms, and the_links are the same as in the input file, and Lx-y Lz-w Lr-o ... represents the movements of the ants in each turn. Each movement should be in the format Lx-y, where x is the ant number (going from 1 to number_of_ants) and y is the name of the room where the ant moves to.

Error Handling:
The program should handle errors carefully and output the appropriate error message if there is any invalid or poorly-formatted input in the input file. The error message should be in the format:

vbnet

ERROR: [error message]

For example, if the input file has no start room, the program should output:

perl

ERROR: invalid data format, no start room found

Good Practices:
The program should respect good programming practices, such as having clear and concise code, using meaningful variable names, using functions to encapsulate code, and writing comments to explain the code.

Testing:
It is recommended to have test files for unit testing to ensure the program works as expected and handles errors correctly.

Conclusion:
The lem-in project is an interesting project that simulates an ant farm where ants need to find the quickest path to cross a colony. The program should read from a file that describes the colony and the ants and output the results in the desired format. The program should handle errors carefully and respect good programming practices.
